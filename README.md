🛠 Tech Stack
Next.js (App Router)
Supabase (Auth + Database + Realtime)
Tailwind CSS
Vercel

Challenges Faced & Solutions
1. Google OAuth Setup
Initially, login redirects were not working correctly.
I fixed this by properly configuring redirect URLs in Supabase, Google Cloud Console, and Vercel environment variables.

2. Row-Level Security (RLS)
At first, users could see all bookmarks.
I enabled RLS and added policies using auth.uid() = user_id to make bookmarks private per user.

3. Real-time Updates
Bookmarks were not syncing across tabs.
I implemented Supabase realtime subscriptions using channel() and handled cleanup properly.

Setup
git clone https://github.com/Jaya1718/smart-bookmark-app.git
